# NClient_Project
- This is a hacktool or (RAT) based on FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
- The program is still in beta version (0.9.1) and not all of its features have been fully developed.
- I, as the developer of the software, am not responsible for the damages that may be caused by the irrational use of the software.
- The program contains several features, including:
  1. Block access to the device screen
  2. Spy on the keyboard
  3. Take a screenshot
  4. Execute any file or program from the hacker's device to the attacking device
  5. Executing cmd commands from the hacker's device
  6. Turn the device on or off
  7. Send messages in different formats
*The software needs an FTP server to communicate with the victim's device, anytime and anywhere (requires internet access)
*There are some antivirus that can detect the payload

tool will be relased soon ...
